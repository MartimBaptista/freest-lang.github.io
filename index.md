# FreeST: session types for mortals

FreeST is a typed concurrent programming language where processes communicate via message-passing.

Messages are exchanged on bidirectional channels. Communication on channels is governed by a 
powerful type system based on polymorphic context-free session types. Built on a core linear 
functional programming language, FreeST features primitives for forking new threads, for 
creating channesl and for communicating on these. The compiler builds on a novel algorithm for deciding the 
equivalence of context-free types.
