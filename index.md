Some themes to have in mind:
- [jekyll-rtd-theme](http://jekyllthemes.org/themes/jekyll-rtd-theme/) - good for documentation and tutorials
- [Documentation](https://jekyllthemes.io/theme/documentation) - for documentation but not as good as jekyll-rtd-theme
- [Just the Docs](https://jekyllthemes.io/theme/just-the-docs) - cool for project websites
- [Hyde](https://jekyllthemes.io/theme/hyde) - minimalistic project theme
- [Minimal Mistakes](https://jekyllthemes.io/theme/minimal-mistakes)
